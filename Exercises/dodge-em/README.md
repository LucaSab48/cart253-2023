# i-like-to-move-it
## Luca Sabelli

For this exercise, i made a bunch of objects that would conglomerate together to form a person wearing glasses with a mohawk. 
I made his mouth size vary depending on the y value of the mouse and the background change color depending on the x and y values of the mouse. 
I added a random nu ber generator between 230 and 255 for the green value of the glasses to make a sort of reflection aspect.
