For this exercise, i made a game where the user controls a cat's x position by using the click of the mouse. There are fishes falling from the top of the canvas and the goal of the game is to catch 10 fishes. When you catch 10 fish, the draw loop ends and a message prints out to inform you that you've won. I made the background filled with colorful bubbles that use random numbers for their size and RGB values. I also made the color of the winning text random.
