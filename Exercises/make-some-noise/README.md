For this exercise, I decided to make a more advanced theremin from the example. This is because my final project is an instrument simulator and I want to include this theremin as one of the instruments. I made it possible for the user to change the wave form of the theremin by clicking buttons on the bottom of the theremin base. I also made the user able to see the frequency, amplitude and current wave form to keep track. I made a quick display for the theremin and gave the buttons more detail as well.
