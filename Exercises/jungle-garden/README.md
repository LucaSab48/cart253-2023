# kill-the-garden
## Luca Sabelli

For this exercise, I decided to make an ironic game of the original concept consisting of removing flowers from a garden to make a parking lot. I made a user controlled construction worker that uses WASD to move around, and when the player is over a flower, it shrinks the flower. The bees still pollinate the flowers, but now they damage our player if they overlap. The player has a set amount of health and his goal is to remove all the flowers to construct the parking lot. I added a new class of object, bunnies, which give the player health if eaten. If the player overlaps, it gives them additional health. The bunnies have a similar movement to the bees but less jittery. The first ending is displayed if the player dies from the bee stings and the second ending is displayed if the player removes all the flowers form the garden. This was a fun exercise and I hope you enjoy playing it!
