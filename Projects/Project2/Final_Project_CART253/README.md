# Pumpkin-Carving-Simulator
## Luca Sabelli

For this first project, i made a pumpkin carving simulation where the player can design their very own pumpkin. I made the user able to switch between different shapes (circle -> C key, triangle -> T key, rectangle -> R key), be able to control the dimensions of the shape with the arrow keys, rotate the shape if desired with the S key, return the shape to its original form before the rotation with the O key, and change the fill of the object to a similar yet different color of orange on all the shapes. Then, if the user clicks down on the mouse, my program will print out an exact copy of the shape the user creates. I also made a delete button in the shape of a knife that allows the player to delete specific objects by double clicking on them. Then, when the player is done making their pumpkin, the user hits the enter button and then can drag the lid off the pumpkin. Once they place it away, a candle will appear and fall into the pumpkin, making it a jack-o-lantern. The lid of the pumpkin will auto-track back to its original place and then the game will go into it's end state. In the end state, a message will appear from a random list of end phrases. There's a secret ending as well, where if the player prints copies of all the shapes 6 times exactly, a message from hell will appear and a sound effect will play. All the images in the program are drawn by me using illustrator for the background and photoshop for the pumpkin, candle, and knife. I took some pre-existing images for the background. The links to those are in the end of this paragraph. This was a challenging project where i got to learn a bunch of new things in javascript and p5, but i feel proud of the end result. I hope you enjoy it as well!
