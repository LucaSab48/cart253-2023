# love-actually
## Luca Sabelli

For this exercise, i made a love simulation where the player can control the green circle using WASD movement. His goal is to reach the white circle and avoid any red object. If he hits the red object, he will never receive the warm embrace of love from the white circle. The white circle can also be controlled by the player. It's movement is a drag and place style. If you move the white circle above a certain area, a secret message will appear. There is another secret way to finish the game. The green circle can move to the other side of the screen when going completely left or right. This makes the game very simple if you figure it out.
